    Hi! My name is Christine Kim. I am a public relations student studying at Syracuse University. This page is a compilation of all my favorite restuarants in Syracuse that I have gotten to know of. I am from South Korea and California and have traveled to many different countries. So my palate is a bit diverse and risk taking. Pick from the menu for your next meal!
